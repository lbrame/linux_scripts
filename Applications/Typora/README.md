# Typora

This script downloads and installs Typora on your system. Nothing is being compiled, since Typora is closed - source software, but, rather, manually installed.

Make sure to download the whole folder first. If you're the command line type, run these commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lbrame/linux_scripts.git
$ cd linux_scripts/Applications/Typora/
$ chmod +x typora_install.sh
$ sudo bash typora_install.sh
```
