# Darklight

This is a simple script I wrote to change the theme of the GNOME shell between a dark and a light vaiant of the Materia Compact theme on the fly with one command. These scripts can be ran either directly, or bound to an alias to your bashrc or zshrc, or scheduled with a cron job. These two scripts assume you have the Materia-GTK theme installed on your system.
