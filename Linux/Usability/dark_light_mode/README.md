# Change between dark and light theme on GNOME shell (WIP)

This is a simple script I wrote to change the theme of the GNOME shell between a dark and a light variant of whatever theme I'm using at the moment on the fly with one command (this information changes often). These scripts can be ran either directly, or bound to an alias to your bashrc or zshrc, or scheduled with a cron job. These two scripts assume you have the Materia-GTK theme installed on your system. Additionally, these scripts are also capable of changing the user's wallpaper accordingly (GNOME 3 only).

This is a Work In Progress. As a workaround, add the absolute addresses to these scripts as an alias to your bashrc (this is a temporary solution until I have more time to work on this project and turn it into something bigger).

To use this tool, change whatever theme I am currently using to yours.
