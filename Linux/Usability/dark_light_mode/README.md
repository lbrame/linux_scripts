# Change between dark and light theme on GNOME shell (WIP)

This is a simple script I wrote to change the theme of the GNOME shell between a dark and a light vaiant of the Materia Compact theme on the fly with one command. These scripts can be ran either directly, or bound to an alias to your bashrc or zshrc, or scheduled with a cron job. These two scripts assume you have the Materia-GTK theme installed on your system.

This is a Work In Progress. As a workaround, add the absolute addresses to these scripts to your bashrc (this is a temporary solution until I have more time to work on this project and turn it into something bigger).
