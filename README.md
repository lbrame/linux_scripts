# linux_scripts
A collection of Linux shell scripts I wrote for automation purposes. This repository will be updated the more scripts I add. These scripts are organized in subfolders and basically automate the boring aspects of my Linux workflow - they may include debloat scripts, quick post-install scripts to install everything I need, scripts to quickly setup development environments once I've figured them out and whatever comes on my mind.
